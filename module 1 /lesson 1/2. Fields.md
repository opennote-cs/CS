# Fields in Computer Science 

Computer science is a vast field with many different domains or facets to mention a few as follows:

* Artificial Intelligence (A.I)
* Computer Systems and Networks
* Database Systems
* Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
* Graphics and Vision
* Software Enginnering
* Bioinformatics (*which are methods and software tools used to understand biological data.*)
* Theory of Computation (*which is basically and generally solving problems using **algorithms.***) 


There are a whole lot of other fields that involve computer science. And of course, there are also many specializations within computer science. 

**E.g**

We could find that someone studied computer science, but only does computer vision or only develop games or a new programming language üë®‚Äçüíª 

That is what makes computer science so fascinating because there's literally ***no limit*** to the directions one can take 

One can apply computer science in agriculture, cooking, beauty, aerospace, leisure, art and so on...
