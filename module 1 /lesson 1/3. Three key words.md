# Three Key Words

You will mostly definitely hear and start using a number of new words and terms along the way and in fact, we've already used them in this lesson.

The three words that are probably the most used in the study of computer science are as follows:

* **Programming**

* **Coding**

  Coding is pretty much the same as programming but ***refers*** to the specifics of translating and writing codes in different languages.
